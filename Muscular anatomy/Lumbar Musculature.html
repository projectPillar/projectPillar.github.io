<h1>Lumbar Musculature</h1>

<h2>Lumbar Multifidus (LM)</h2>
<br>
The multifidus is a deep local spinal muscle that spans the entire length of the spine. The multifidus muscle originates on the transverse processes and inserts 
onto the spinous process of the vertebrae above, spanning 1-3 segments depending on whether you are looking at the deep, intermediate, or superficial fibres.
The lumbar portion is found on either side of the lumbar vertebrae (L1-L5). LM has been shown to provide segmental stabilization at rest and proprioceptive control
during movement, in addition to playing a key role in the transferral of forces from the lower extremities through the kinetic chain.
