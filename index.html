<h1>Introduction</h1>
<br>
ITK SNAP is a software program that allows users to complete segmentations of medical images. While commonly used for brain imaging, ITK SNAP can be used to segment other structures within the body both in 2D and 3D. For further details on what ITK SNAP is and its creators, please visit <a href='http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php'>http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php</a>. Here, we present a reference guide for manual segmentation of MRI images of lumbar spine musculature for users new to ITK SNAP.

System protocols and additional videos of using the software can be found here: <a href='http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Videos.SNAP3'>http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Videos.SNAP3</a>. Please note that these training videos use MRI images of the brain and not the lumbar spine. The goal of the current page is to introduce the ITK SNAP software to the lumbar spine community specifically as a means for segmenting lumbar spine musculature.
